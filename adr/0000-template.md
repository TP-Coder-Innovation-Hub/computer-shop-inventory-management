# Computer Shop Inventory Management System

## Status

What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?

## Context

I will create a warehouse management system to help reduce errors

## Decision

I will implement the system as a web-based application, with the backend built in Node.js and the frontend using React and data will be stored in a Mysql database

## Consequences

- Make it easier to check stocks via website.
- Can be accessed on multiple devices
